# AlumniDatabase
This was a four person group project in which we has to design and implement a database that allows students to connect with alumni that can become mentors for currents student. A quick overview of the project is available in the "CSU_Alumni_DBMS" pdf file as it is the presentation we gave going over every aspect of the project. The project requirements are detailed in the "CSU Alumni Links In Action" pdf file. The "PhaseIII.SQLQuestions" text file are the data manipulation language sql queries we hand to answer in the "CSCI_3310_project_questions" sql file. These SQL files are all written for Oracle DBMS.
